# VBA-Challenge

Note:

As far as I can tell the only files you will be interested in seeing are:
1. Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm
2. Module1.vbs (or Module.bas they're the same**)
3. ScreenshotYear2018Results.png
4. ScreenshotYear2019Results.png
5. ScreenshotYear2020Results.png
6. README.md

**I copied my Module1 VBA code into two file types (Module1.vbs and Module1.bas) so you could choose which ever is more convenient. These files are identical EXCEPT that the .bas when exported from Excel's VBA Editor adds the line at the top 'Attribute VB_Name = "Module1"' but without the single quotes.
